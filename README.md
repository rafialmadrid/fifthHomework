This app is a simple calendar that provides the user with several blocks that represent each hour of the day. 

At the top, the user is provided with the current date and each block will change color depending on the current time. The following detail wha each color represents:
1. Grey - Past hours
2. Red - Present hour
3. Green - Future hours

The user can also input text to each block and when the button to save is pressed the data is stored in the local storage. The user can refresh or close the page and the data will remain.
